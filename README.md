# Ree2Jinx (Codename ImaginaryConsoleEmulator)
Attempting to make a NS2 emulator pre-release.

## NOTE

Please don't expect to boot any NS2 games, this is purely for acedemic and research purposes - and as a challenge to see if I can even draw a single frame - or even load a single ROM file into memory, not to screw over the big N. I don't even plan on adding support for game booting because I'm kinda bad at this - and I don't want to screw over any game publishers/the big N. Hope yall understand! :-3
